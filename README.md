# Windows Service Monitor

### About

This program can be configured to monitor the status of Windows Services across multiple workstations or servers, as well as providing the ability to stop and start services as needed.

### Usage

No installation is required, just move ServiceMonitor.exe and ServiceMonitor.exe.config out of windows_service_monitor/bin/Release onto the machine the monitor will be run from. The config file must be located in the same directory as the executable, and has a few default examples that can be updated to fit your needs. Once your configuration looks good, run the executable as an administrator.
