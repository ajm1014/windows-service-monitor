# Windows Service Monitor

## About

This program can be configured to monitor the status of Windows Services across multiple workstations or servers, as well as providing the ability to stop and start services as needed.

## Usage

No installation is required, you only need to move ServiceMonitor.exe and ServiceMonitor.exe.config out of windows_service_monitor/bin/Release into a folder on the computer the program will run from. The config file has a few default examples that can be updated to fit your needs. Once your config looks good, run the executable as an administrator.
